     * Paths with Sum

     * You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive or negative).
     * Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value.
     * The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf,
     * but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
