     * Rank from Stream
     * 
     * Imagine you are reading in a stream of integers.
     * Periodically, you wish to be able to look up the rank of a numberx (the number of values less than or equal to x).
     * Implement the data structures and algorithms to support these operations.
     * That is, implement the method track ( int x), which is called when each number is generated,
     * and the method getRankOfNumber(int x), which returns the number of values less than or equal to x (not including x itself).
     * 
     * EXAMPLE
     * Stream (in order of appearance): 5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 9, 7, 13, 3
     * getRankOfNumber(1) = 0
     * getRankOfNumber(3) = 1
     * getRankOfNumber(4) = 3
     *
