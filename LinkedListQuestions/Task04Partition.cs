     * Partition
     * 
     * Write code to partition a linked list around a value x,
     * such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.
     * If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x (see below).
     * The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition";
     * it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
     * 
     * EXAMPLE
     * Input:
     * Output:
     * 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition= 5]
     * 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
