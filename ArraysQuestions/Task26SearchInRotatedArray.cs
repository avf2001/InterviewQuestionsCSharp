     * Search in Rotated Sorted Array
     * 
     * Given a sorted array of n integers that has been rotated an unknown number of times,
     * write code to find an element in the array. You may assume that the array was originally sorted in increasing order.
     * EXAMPLE
     * Input: findSin{lS, 16, 19, 20, 25, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14}
     * Output: 8 (the index of 5 in the array)
