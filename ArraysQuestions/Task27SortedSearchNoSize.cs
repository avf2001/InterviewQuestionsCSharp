     * Sorted Search, No Size

     * You are given an array-like data structure Listy which lacks a size method.
     * It does, however, have an elementAt ( i) method that returns the element at index i in O(1) time.
     * If i is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it returns -1.
     * (For this reason, the data structure only supports positive integers.)
     * Given a Li sty which contains sorted, positive integers, find the index at which an element x occurs.
     * If x occurs multiple times, you may return any index.
